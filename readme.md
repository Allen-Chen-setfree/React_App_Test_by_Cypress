# QA code task (technical role)

The application consists of two projects - UI (React SPA) and API (ASP.Net Core).

The application has 4 pages:
- home page
- factorial - a user should be able to calculate *n!*
- fibonacci - a user should be able to calculate *Fib(n)*
- random square - a user should be able to calculate *rand(0, n)^2*

You will need to:
- Implement missing features in the UI
    > Please start the application (see instructions below) and explore it to understand what needs to be implemented.
- Make sure the application logic is working correctly
- Cover the application logic with tests

## This code task is to test a candidate's ability to (non exhaustive list):
- code
- write automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end as required)
- use git
- decide on testing strategy
- pay attention to details
- own and improve the code as required

## Preferred tech frameworks (if required)
- UI: Jest, Cypress
- API: NUnit

## Before start

- Install dotnet SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- Install Yarn package manager: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

- NB: Current app has been tested with:
node: v10.16.0
yarn: 1.22.4
dotnet: 3.1.202
npm: 6.9.0
